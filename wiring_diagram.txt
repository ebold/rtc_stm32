Wiring diagram between the Nucleo board and custom LED module

1. Components
- Nucleo-F103RB board
- LED module
- 10 pin flat cable with micro-match plug (TE connectivity)

2. Setup

Once the Nucleo board is programmed it is powered by an USB charger.
Therefore the jumper JP1 must be set to ON to allow target STM32 to be powered [1].

3. Wiring/cabling (Signal_name: LED_module:connector:pin_number <-> STM_board:connector:pin_name)

Clock, data and control signals
SCK: LED:X:3    <-> Nucleo:CN5:SCK/D13
SDO: LED:X:6    <-> Nucleo:CN5:PWM/MOSI/D11
LDO: LED:X:4    <-> Nucleo:CN5:D8
OE:  LED:X:5    <-> Nucleo:CN9:D7

Power
+4V: LED:X:8    <-> Nucleo:CN6:3V3
GND: LED:X:9,10 <-> Nucleo:CN6:GND
